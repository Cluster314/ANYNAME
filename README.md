Hi, Im Abdulrahman Mohammed!
This is actually a 2-user account, I use the repo "ANYNAME", and my Brother, Abdulqawi Mohammed, uses the repo "Coding-Shinobi7".
The owner of this account is actually my Brother.
So now let's talk about me!
I'm 9 years old.
My favorite color is a specific shade of blue, the CSS color is deepskyblue.
So now let's talk about my coding skills!
I think I'm somewhere around Intermediate and Professional
I work on Python and HTML.
But I also use CSS and JS, I use Internal CSS and JS!
That's why it only says Python and HTML!
I guess that's all I've got to say for this repo, and also check out all my projects(programs), So Bye!
